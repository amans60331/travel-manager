# In production (on Vercel), this variable should point to your Render backend URL.
# Example:
# VITE_API_URL=https://travel-manager-api.onrender.com

# For now, we leave it commented out locally so we use the local proxy.
# When you deploy to Vercel, add this variable in the Vercel Dashboard Settings.
